    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, this is a browser extension that attempts to do a better job of social media
      filtering. It attempts to scrape social media sites at the browser level for
      their text content, run it against a sentiment analyzer (for now) and blur out
      or remove the post from your view.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should not need to read anything and it does not need to feed it back to
      the service that you blocked something. You do not have to trust the social
      media site to honor your block request this way.
    </p>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <li> Topic labelling + filtering - Use a classifier to automatically detect and filter topics like politics</li>
    <li> Username similarity checking - Check username similarities to maintain blocked users across social networks</li>
